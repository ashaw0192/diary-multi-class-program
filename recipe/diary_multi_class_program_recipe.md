# DIARY MULTI-CLASS PROGRAM RECIPE

## 1. Describe the Problem

* As a user
So that I can record my experiences
I want to keep a regular diary

* As a user
So that I can reflect on my experiences
I want to read my past diary entries

* As a user
So that I can reflect on my experiences in my busy day
I want to select diary entries to read based on how much time I have and my reading speed

* As a user
So that I can keep track of my tasks
I want to keep a todo list along with my diary

* As a user
So that I can keep track of my contacts
I want to see a list of all of the mobile phone numbers in all my diary entries

take aways - 
1) first class = diary: input diary entries, save diary entries
2) second class = diary entries: output
3) analyse diary entries given users criteria(wpm, readspeed)
4) third class = todo: input todo entries, save todo, output todo
5) extract phone numbers from diary entries

key words -
1) n - diary, diary entries
   v - record, keep
2) n - diary entries
   v - read
3) n - time, reading speed, diary entries
   v - select 
4) n - tasks, diary entries 
   v - keep, track
5) n - mobile numbers, list, diary entries
   v - keep, track, list

##Â 2. Design the Class System

```Ruby
#.lib/diary.rb
class Diary 

  public 

  def initialize
   @diary_list = []
   @todo_list = []
   @mobile_numbers = []
  end 

  def add (entry)
    #Instance of diary_entry class
    #Returns Nothing 
    #Adds to diary entry list 
  end 

  def display
    #Returns list of diary entries
  end 

  def best_entry (wpm,time)
    #Deliberate choice: returns the SINGLE largest diary entry that can be 
    #read within reading time. Not how many entries can be provided within reading time 
    #wpm is an integer, provided each time the method is called (ie not set somewhere else)
    #time is an integer, provided each time the method is called (ie not set somewhere else)
  end 

  def show_todo_list 
    #returns todo list
  end

  def show_mobile_numbers
    #returns a list of mobile numbers taken from entries
  end

  private

  def add_todo
    #add entry to todo list if it contains todo
  end

  def add_mobile
    #entracts mobile number and adds it to mobile number list
  end

end 

#./lib/diary_entry.rb
class DiaryEntry 

  def ininitialize (text)
    #text is a string that contains an entry for the diary 
  end 

  def contents 
    #returns text 
  end 

  def length_of_entry
    #return word count as an integer
  end

  def contains_todo?
    #returns true/false depending on whether todo present
  end

  def contains_mobile_number?
    #returns true/false depending on whether entry contains a valid mobile number
  end

end 

```

## 3. Create Examples as Integration Tests and Unit Tests

```Ruby

#__Unit tests: Diary___ 

#1 - prints an empty array 

diary = Diary.new 
diary.display # => []

#2 - if no diary entries, best entry method raises error

diary = Diary.new 
diary.best_entry # => "no entries fit your specification"

#___Unit tests: Diary_entry__

#1 - if no diary entry

diary_entry = DiaryEntry.new("")
diary_entry.contains_todo? # => false
diary_entry.contents # => ""
diary_entry.length_of_entry # => 0
diary_entry.contains_mobile_number? # =>

#2 - Returns a diary entry 

diary_entry = DiaryEntry.new("today I wrote some code")
diary_entry.contents # => "today I wrote some code"

#3 - Calculates entry length 

diary_entry = DiaryEntry.new("today I wrote some code")
diary_entry.length_of_contents # => "5"

#4 - Diary entry containing no todo

diary_entry = DiaryEntry.new("today I wrote some code")
diary_entry.contains_todo? # => false

#5 - Diary entry containing todo

diary_entry1 = DiaryEntry.new("today I need to write some code #TODO".)
diary_entry2 = DiaryEntry.new("today I need #TODO some code.|")
diary_entry3 = DiaryEntry.new("#TODO today I need to write some code".)
diary_entry4 = DiaryEntry.new("#TODO: today I need to write some code".)
diary_entry5 = DiaryEntry.new("(#TODO) today I need to write some code".)
diary_entry1.contains_todo? # => true
diary_entry2.contains_todo? # => true
diary_entry3.contains_todo? # => true
diary_entry4.contains_todo? # => true
diary_entry5.contains_todo? # => true

#6 - Diary entries containing no, or the wrong formatted, todo

diary_entry1 = DiaryEntry.new("today I need todo something, i'm so bored".)
diary_entry2 = DiaryEntry.new("today I need some codein.")
diary_entry3 = DiaryEntry.new("#todo today I need to write some code".)
diary_entry4 = DiaryEntry.new("#TO DO today I cold".)
diary_entry5 = DiaryEntry.new("#TO-DO I need to write some code".)
diary_entry6 = DiaryEntry.new("#TODO")
diary_entry1.contains_todo? # => false
diary_entry2.contains_todo? # => false
diary_entry3.contains_todo? # => false
diary_entry4.contains_todo? # => false
diary_entry5.contains_todo? # => false
diary_entry6.contains_todo? # => false

# .... .split(".", "?", "!").select{&:include?( "#TODO" )} .... ?


#__Integration tests___ 

#1 - adds a diary entry created by to_do.list class

diary = Diary.new
diary_entry = DiaryEntry.new("today I wrote some code")
diary.add(diary_entry)
diary.display # => ["today I wrote some code"]


#2 - returns 2 diary entries when 2 are added 

diary = Diary.new
diary_entry1 = DiaryEntry.new("today I wrote some code")
diary.add(diary_entry1)
diary_entry2 = DiaryEntry.new("tomorrow I will write some more code")
diary.add(diary_entry2)
diary.display # => ["today I wrote some code", "tomorrow I will write some more code"]

#3 - given one diary entry that is readable within wpm and time availble, returns entry 

diary = Diary.new
diary_entry1 = DiaryEntry.new("today " * 60)
diary.add(diary_entry1)
diary.best_entry(60,1) # => "today " * 60

#4 - given one diary entry that is not readable within the time, raises error

diary = Diary.new
diary_entry1 = DiaryEntry.new("tomorrow " * 61)
diary.add(diary_entry1)
diary.best_entry(60,1) # => "no entries fit your specification"

#5 - given two diary entries, with only one readable within time, return that entry 

diary = Diary.new
diary_entry1 = DiaryEntry.new("tomorrow " * 61)
diary.add(diary_entry1)
diary_entry2 = DiaryEntry.new("yesterday " * 59)
diary.add(diary_entry2)
diary.best_entry(60,1) # => "yesterday " * 59"

#6 - given two diary entries of equal length return only one entry 

diary = Diary.new
diary_entry1 = DiaryEntry.new("tomorrow " * 60)
diary.add(diary_entry1)
diary_entry2 = DiaryEntry.new("yesterday " * 60)
diary.add(diary_entry2)
diary.best_entry(60,1) # => "tomorrow " * 60 || "yesterday " * 60

#7 - given two diary entries readable within the time, ensure that 
  #the larger of the two is returned

diary = Diary.new
diary_entry1 = DiaryEntry.new("Monday " * 58)
diary.add(diary_entry1)
diary_entry2 = DiaryEntry.new("Tuesday " * 59)
diary.add(diary_entry2)
diary.best_entry(60,1) # => "Tuesday " * 59 

#8 - given an empty string as a diary entry, adds it to diary list and returns it 

diary = Diary.new
diary_entry1 = DiaryEntry.new("")
diary.add(diary_entry1)
diary.display # => [""]

#9 - given a diary contents containing no todos

diary = Diary.new
diary_entry = DiaryEntry.new("")
diary.show_todo_list # => []

#10 - given a non todo

diary = Diary.new
diary_entry = DiaryEntry.new("saw a fun cat :)")
diary.show_todo_list # => []

#11 - given a todo

diary = Diary.new
diary_entry = DiaryEntry.new("#TODO find cat")
diary.show_todo_list # => ["#TODO find cat"]

#12 - given two diary entries only one is a todo

diary = Diary.new
diary_entry1 = DiaryEntry.new("cat gone :(")
diary_entry2 = DiaryEntry.new("#TODO find cat again")
diary.show_todo_list # => ["#TODO find cat again"]

#13 - given two todos

diary = Diary.new
diary_entry1 = DiaryEntry.new("feed cat #TODO")
diary_entry2 = DiaryEntry.new("#TODO find cat again")
diary.show_todo_list # => ["feed cat #TODO", "#TODO find cat again"]


```

## 4. Implement the Behaviour

For each example you create as a test, implement the behaviour that allows the class to behave according to your example.

Then return to step 3 until you have addressed the problem you were given. You may also need to revise your design, for example if you realise you made a mistake earlier.
